Inspiration
As international students, we usually find it hard to minimize our grocery costs since we donâ€™t know which stores offer good quality products at minimum prices. This web application can be beneficial to students and anyone who just moved-in to a new city.

What it does
GrocerLess is a web application that helps customers save money spent on groceries by locating a nearby store that sells the list of grocery items at a minimum total price. Customers enter the list of the groceries they want to purchase and the web application returns a list of stores along with their locations where the list of items are available at an economical price.

How we built it
We initially created a dummy database (as Excel CSV files) to use in our application as we didn't have an actual database that syncs with our needs for building the web app. The front-end is developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and our back-end is coded in Python to return the minimum price, the store name, and store location. The front-end and back-end are connected through Flask.

Challenges we ran into
We had a hard time finding a database suitable for the working of our web app. Furthermore, we could not find grocery API datasets that have real-time data. We also struggled in integrating the frontend with the backend using Flask. In addition to all of that, we are new to web design.

In order to run the web application, Flask must be installed in the computer and the "main.py" Python file is to be called through Terminal. Then, go to the local host address to access the web application.
